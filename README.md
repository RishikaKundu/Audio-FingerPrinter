# Audio-FingerPrinter

An audio recognition system that fingerprints songs and identifies them from a recorded clip or live input. The system uses hashing and map data structures for efficient song matching.

Main Tasks:

* Fingerprinting Songs: Analyze a directory of songs to create unique digital fingerprints for each. These fingerprints are stored in a hash map to allow quick lookups.
* Matching Songs: When a user inputs an audio clip or records a sound, generate a fingerprint for the input. Compare this fingerprint to the stored ones to identify the song.

Things I Learned:

* Implementing audio fingerprinting algorithms
* Utilizing hash maps for fast data retrieval
* Handling audio data and frequency domain transformations
