# Audio-FingerPrinter




Main Tasks:

* Fingerprinting Songs: Analyze a directory of songs to create unique digital fingerprints for each. These fingerprints are stored in a hash map to allow quick lookups.
* Matching Songs: When a user inputs an audio clip or records a sound, generate a fingerprint for the input. Compare this fingerprint to the stored ones to identify the song.
